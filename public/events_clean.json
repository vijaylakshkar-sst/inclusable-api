        "description": "The Broken Hill Mundi Mundi Bash is Australia's ultimate outback music festival, set against the breathtaking backdrop of the Mundi Mundi Plains, just outside of Broken Hill, NSW. This all-ages, family-friendly event is a celebration of iconic Australian music, camping, and adventure, drawing thousands from across the country to experience the magic of the outback.\n\nHeld annually, the Bash features a stellar lineup of legendary Australian artists. Past performers have included household names like Icehouse, Hoodoo Gurus, The Angels, and Missy Higgins, creating an electric atmosphere under the wide open skies. Beyond the music, the festival offers a variety of quirky activities such as the famous 'Mundi Undi Run' and the world-record Nutbush dance attempt—both raising funds for the Royal Flying Doctor Service. Festival-goers can also get involved in the \"Big Blue Day\" supporting mental health charity Beyond Blue.\n\nPerfect for caravanners, campers, and road trippers, the festival is a BYO camping event with designated areas for families and dog owners. Facilities include composting toilets and food stalls, but the real highlight is the chance to disconnect, relax, and soak up incredible sunsets over the vast, unspoiled landscape.\n\nThe Broken Hill Mundi Mundi Bash is more than a festival - it's an unforgettable outback adventure, blending music, mateship, and Aussie spirit in one of the country's most iconic desert settings.",

The bonus of the scenes filmed in Carinda and the Warrumbungle National Park created the magical backdrop for what many regards as Bowie's most distinctive and powerful video. Since that date, the pub has become a mecca for Bowie fans from all over the world, looking to stand and be photographed in the same spot where Bowie filmed his video. The town itself has now embraced this historic connection and hosts an annual \"Let's Dance Carinda\" festival paying tribute to and celebrating David Bowie and his remarkable music legacy.\n\n​",

The festival is held annually over the October Long Weekend.\n\nOn Saturday, the main program features a lineup of artists and bands, workshops for visitors, demonstrations of sheep shearing and crutching, and a dog jumping competition. The festival encourages attendees to dress up as David Bowie, with competitions for the best-dressed lookalikes in male, female, and children's categories. One of the highlights is the 'Red Shoe Tent,' where visitors can paint their old shoes red and participate in a colouring competition for children. \n\nOn Sunday, a reenactment of the Let's Dance film clip is performed at the Carinda Hotel, where this incomparable event showcases exactly where Bowie stood, with the original wall tiles behind him. \n\nAdditionally, the festival hosts a street parade on Sunday of the long weekend, where many enthusiastic participants dress in David Bowie-inspired costumes. \n\nThis event aims to enhance local community engagement, foster social connections, and encourage fans of David Bowie to enjoy a fun-filled weekend, travelling to the Country and Outback region of New South Wales.",

Be moved and entranced as you listen to powerful tales and melodies, and preview some songs from Uncle Roger's new studio album Buluunarbi and The Old North Star. Don't miss this uplifting evening in the BAMM garden, gathered around the fire pits, under the winter night sky. \n\nRoger Knox was raised on the Toomelah Aboriginal Mission Station on the bend of the Macintyre River. Charlie Duncan taught him how to play guitar at an early age and Roger also loved to sing with his mother and grandmother in the church choir. Although Gospel music was his first love, once he found his way to Tamworth in his late teens Roger's passion for Country music grew and he began to invest it with his own Aboriginal style. \n\nNow in 2025, as a seasoned entertainer and story teller, he tours nationally and internationally, performing in mainstream and across First Nation communities. \n\nToby Martin is a musician and songwriter. He is perhaps best known as the lead singer of Sydney/Gadigal band Youth Group, with whom he has released five albums, toured the world, won an ARIA, and had a Number One single in 2006 with 'Forever Young'.",

While incarcerated, Andrew began noticing the transformative power of laughter. After all, if a joke can make you forget you’re in prison, what else can it do? \n\nUpon his release, Andrew took up stand-up comedy, initially under strict bail conditions where his parents had to come with him to shows, and he had to be home in time for curfew. \n\nA year later, Andrew performed his debut solo show ‘Jokes About the Time I Went to Prison’, at the 2023 Melbourne International Comedy Festival. Andrew’s show garnered him critical acclaim, along with a nomination for Best Newcomer.",

The wild, hedonistic lifestyle the band witnessed of the youth in the 70s is ultimately what gave birth to their seminal rock anthem, Run To Paradise. It’s all about the stories that sound all too familiar within the culture widely assumed of the music industry - “sex, drugs, and rock ‘n’ roll” and they tell it all.\n\nRun To Paradise is a “spilling of the beans” of sorts. It’s part story, part song that chronicles through some of the wildest, most risqué, outrageous, and downright hilarious stories of Australian Rock. All, as these Oz pub-rock icons recall it.\n\nAnd behind the narrative are the classic songs that define the musical landscape of rock music in the ’70s and 80s, including Deep Purple’s “Smoke On The Water”, Chuck Berry’s ‘Never Can Tell’, TMG’s ‘Jump In My Car’, Dragon’s ‘Are You Old Enough’, AC/DC’s ‘Long Way To The Top’ and of course the Choirboys hits ‘Boys will Be Boys’ ‘Never Gonna Die’ ‘Struggletown’ and the pub-rock anthem ‘Run to Paradise’, to name a few.",

Aesthetically, the works draw on the history of textile banners as artefacts used for activism, including the women's suffrage campaign, as well as banners displayed in town halls and churches.\n\nThe exhibition demonstrates that Australian women's quest for freedom and equality is ongoing. Many of the social issues raised by early activists remain vitally relevant today, including equal pay, sexual harassment, family violence, and female representation in Parliament and business.\n\nChangemakers focuses on women's empowerment and demonstrates that crafting — traditionally considered 'women's work' — can be used for political expression and social change.\n\nChangemakers: Crafting a difference is a travelling exhibition from the Museum of Australian Democracy at Old Parliament House, sponsored by Commonwealth Bank as part of CommBank Next Chapter, a program helping victim survivors of financial abuse achieve long-term financial independence.",

Together, their reflective and site-responsive new commissions, traverse internal and external worlds, embracing the sensory and cyclical rhythms of light and sound, thinking, and feeling, listening and seeing, interwoven with ideas of material memory.  \n\nBetween Waves is an exhibition developed by the Australian Centre for Contemporary Art (ACCA) touring nationally with NETS Victoria, curated by Jessica Clark. \n\nThis project has been supported by Creative Victoria through the Yalingwa Visual Arts Initiative and the NETS Victoria Exhibition Development Fund; and the Australian Government's Visions of Australia program.",

        "description": "In Sowing N' Sewing Gilgandra-based artist Clementine Belle McIntosh challenges the human-centric relationships which define her inherent \"sense of place\". Combining textiles with traditional painting techniques and impulsive mark-marking with nonhuman collaboration, McIntosh's textile installations reflect the dynamic and complex interactions present between local environments, industries, and communities in the context of rural Australia.\n\nA continuation of McIntosh's regenerative approach to art making, Sowing N' Sewing invites viewers to be enveloped by the textile materials utilised and consider the narratives of the land, the industry that relies on it and the people that live within it. Thus, allowing you to build your own associations towards a \"sense of place\".&nbsp;\n\nThis is a HomeGround exhibition, produced by the WPCC and supported by Orana Arts.

Man, myth, would-be baronet, peep show oddity and pauper, who was Tom Castro, and did he ever really exist?\n\nThe Museum of the Riverina brings this amazing story to life in the wonderfully evocative surrounds of our Historic Council Chambers.

        "description": "Clarice Beckett: Paintings from the National Collection presents an intimate, rarely seen group of works by one of the most original artists of early twentieth century Australia.\n\nDeeply sensitive to the effects of colour, light and atmosphere, Beckett painted the life and scenery of her coastal home in south-east Naarm/Melbourne with an eye for the commonplace and fleeting effects of nature. Her work captures a world on the cusp of modernisation, evoking both the natural environment and simple pleasures of suburbia.\n\nIn 1972, the artist's sister Hilda Mangan donated a group of Beckett's works to the National Gallery. It is this collection that will be on view for the first time, their freshness and vitality recently restored by extensive conservation treatment.\nClarice Beckett: Paintings from the National Collection is a National Gallery Touring Exhibition supported by The Australian Government through Visions of Australia.\n\nCurators:\nElspeth Pitt, Senior Curator, Australian Art\nDeirdre Cannon, Assistant Curator, Australian Art",

His first solo exhibition was held at the Nundah Galleries in Canberra in 1966. Thereafter, Wicks travelled and studied in Europe and New York. He was awarded a French Government Scholarship in 1967 to study printmaking with renowned British printmaker Stanley Hayter at his Paris studio. Wicks returned to Australia in the mid-1980s, producing art, teaching and exhibiting in metropolitan and regional galleries.\n\nThis exhibition celebrates Arthur's exceptional, colour-field abstract paintings, produced on the eve of the founding of Wagga Wagga Art Gallery, 50 years ago.",

By drawing on the rich history of Megalo Print Studio's archive, Canberra vs the Government provides an insightful exploration into the medium of print as a tool for describing and building communities both locally and internationally.\n\nWith the youth unemployment rate surging to 23.2% for 15-19 year olds and 13.4% for 20-24 year olds in Canberra in 1980, Megalo International Screenprint Collective was born. Canberra, home to around 180,000 people, primarily young families, was suffering and one organisation, Jobless Action, was busy setting up enterprises with the aim of providing spaces for young people to create their own jobs.\n\nHoused in the laundry of a former migrant camp on the flanks of Mt Ainslie, right behind the Australian War Memorial, Megalo started out producing screenprinted posters advertising community events and services, agitating for social change and championing political action.\n\n\nShowcasing works from the early, and often very raw, screen prints to beautifully sophisticated lithographs, Canberra vs the Government is an exhibition not to be missed.",

        "description": "Sculptures in the Garden is an exciting event that combines garden design, large-scale Australian sculpture and traditional art mediums in beautiful rural surroundings within a private garden and vineyard in Mudgee.\n\nNow in its 15th year, Sculptures in the Garden is Mudgee and regional NSW's largest and most renowned outdoor sculpture exhibition. The outdoor exhibition runs for 16 days. Sculptures in the Garden has become a hallmark event on the Central West's artistic calendar and a major tourist attraction, showcasing sculptures from emerging and established artists. \n\nFounded by art director and owner of Rosby, Kay Norton-Knight, Sculptures in the Garden was her dream child. Kay was passionate about providing a new and unique platform for the exhibition and sale of sculptors' works. \n\nSculptures in the Garden is a not-for-profit organisation and as such any profits are distributed between the establishment of a sculpture walk in Mudgee and the local charity, Support Group of Guide Dogs NSW/ACT.",

They have also shared the bill with the likes of Jeff Beck, Foreigner, Journey, Twisted Sister, Thin Lizzy and Kelly Rowland. \n\nJohn Blunt’s (lead singer) resemblance to Freddie Mercury is uncanny, appearing live to seven million viewers on the French TV show “Qui Sera Le Meilleur Sosie? -  Who will be the best impersonator” and John was chosen by UK’s ITV Channel 5 for the docu/drama “The Freddie Mercury Story – Who Wants to Live Forever”, a detailed look into the personal life and death of Freddie Mercury, screening in the UK, Europe and North America in 2016.\n\nThis two-hour live show consists of all Queen's Greatest Hits (and stage costumes), including Bohemian Rhapsody, We Will Rock You, We Are the Champions, Somebody to Love, Radio Ga Ga, Another One Bites the Dust and many more.\n\nThis will be an unforgettable Killer Queen Experience!",

Other components refer both to Dawson’s artistic palette and his childhood spent in Albury. There are bowling balls, gym crash mats, and significantly, a 10,000-year-old section of river red gum salvaged from sand quarries on the Albury Wodonga causeway.\n\nCombined in a steel structure resembling a 1980s jungle gym, the pieces form a time capsule of an artist’s life and work - the “material links” that have connected his work for years are presented with the “fizzy drinks” excitement of a children’s playground.\n\nAbout the Artist\n\nUsing chemistry, mechanics and construction techniques, Marley Dawson creates sculptures and installations that highlight aspects of our world and selves that can be uncanny, surreal and extraordinary. Canberra-based, Albury-raised, Dawson has been exhibiting extensively for over a decade in Australia and internationally.",

Meules, milieu du jour [Haystacks, midday] 1890 is a glorious work from this series, filled with dazzling light and luminous colour.\n\nThe Sharing the National Collection initiative will see major works of art from the National Gallery of Australia’s collection exhibited across regional and suburban communities.\n\nThis work of art is on long-term loan from the National Gallery of Australia with support from the Australian Government as part of Sharing the National Collection.",

This set the wheels in motion for what has become a very rich and enduring touring history with over twelve years on the world stage, performing to well over half a million enthusiastic patrons in over thirty countries, who have aptly described Andrews’ performance as “fantastic” “brilliant” “the real deal” and “a real showman”. Greg Andrew and his band pay homage to Elton John in his two-hour concert production, which takes its name from one of the British singer-songwriter's most-loved tracks – \"Rocketman\".\n\nRocketman in Concert - On Reflection Tour celebrates the Greatest Hits from the Elton John and Bernie Taupin collection! Greg’s Elton John Experience will have you second guessing yourself that you’ve not seen the real Elton.",

This is the award-winning Celtic-Rock ensemble that the Department of Foreign Affairs &amp; Trade is warning everyone about. Throw caution to the wind and set forth on a musical journey through the lands of the Celts as Murphy's Pigs drag you headfirst into their world of rugged mountains, stormy oceans, fearsome battles, unrequited love and a drop or two of the whiskey. \n\nTheir unrehearsed style breathes new life into old favourites and firmly places their unique stamp on contemporary treasures … and some not-too-shabby stuff they've written themselves. Mildly humorous onstage banter, an insane number of instruments and robust, manly voices unite to create an experience that will, unfortunately, be seared deep into your memory long after the performance is over. Boisterous chorus songs and lilting ballads compel the tone deaf to sing fervently while spirited jigs, reels and hornpipes spur the uncoordinated out onto the dance floor. \n\nAfter selling out their last six shows, you won't want to miss a great night's entertainment with these twelve charmers and their accompanied dancers (who are even more charming).",

The wild, hedonistic lifestyle the band witnessed of the youth in the 70s is ultimately what gave birth to their seminal rock anthem, Run To Paradise. It’s all about the stories that sound all too familiar within the culture widely assumed of the music industry - “sex, drugs, and rock ‘n’ roll” and they tell it all.\n\nRun To Paradise is a “spilling of the beans” of sorts. It’s part story, part song that chronicles through some of the wildest, most risqué, outrageous, and downright hilarious stories of Australian Rock. All, as these Oz pub-rock icons recall it.\n\nAnd behind the narrative are the classic songs that define the musical landscape of rock music in the ’70s and '80s, including Deep Purple’s “Smoke On The Water”, Chuck Berry’s ‘Never Can Tell’, TMG’s ‘Jump In My Car’, Dragon’s ‘Are You Old Enough’, AC/DC’s ‘Long Way To The Top’ and of course, the Choirboys hits ‘Boys Will Be Boys’ ‘Never Gonna Die’ ‘Struggletown’ and the pub-rock anthem ‘Run to Paradise’, to name a few.",

The opening day will coincide with the International Day of Sign Language, with Auslan being recognized and incorporated throughout the festival. Planned events include a free community picnic and concert, culinary \"taste\" experiences, a Dangerous Ideas-style keynote, ticketed performances and films, a community photographic exhibition, and more.

This historic building is located at 16 Stanley Street on the western side of the Macquarie River in the area of the old Government settlement.\n\nThe building was reopened after its recent repair and refurbishment in July 2012.  This was the first major work on the building since the mid-1960s. Bathurst is a historic city, and it is imperative that historic buildings be saved such as this building.\n\nOld Government Cottage was opened as a museum in 1965 by Sir Eric Woodward, Governor of NSW, as part of Bathurst's sesquicentennial celebration. It was believed at the time that the cottage had been built in 1817 as the residence of the Commandant of the Bathurst Settlement, established in 1815 by Governor Macquarie. Subsequent research has established that the Commandant's residence, also known as Government House, was a short distance away. However, the origins of Old Government Cottage remain a mystery, but worth the opportunity to visit.",

Working across installation, video and intervention, Mystery of Missing Westerlies considers pasts, presents and futures in an interconnected planetary atmospheric frame.\n\nThe disappearance of the westerly winds is itself both a historical anomaly and a planetary omen. We treat this climatic rupture as an atmospheric case file, a study in atmospheric disappearance, inviting consideration of the interplay between absence, evidence, and the forces shaping our world. Here, wind becomes both subject and metaphor—an invisible actor whose movements carry sediments, shape deserts, and drive oceanic currents, but also a narrative force whose disappearance tells of shifting global patterns. Embedded within this body of work are material traces of evidence and investigation, material clues in a wider investigation of climate, memory, and time.",

As part of the Converge residency program, they've been creating new work under bright studio lights—experimenting, collaborating, and engaging with the community through workshops, events, and artistic exchange.\n \nNow, in the final two weeks of the residency, the artists will present the culmination of their year-long journey in a group exhibition. Spanning film, ceramics, sculpture, painting, installation, printmaking, costume design, and participatory projects, the show highlights the depth and diversity of practice within this vibrant creative cohort.\n\nExhibiting artists: Aaron McGarry, Adrienne Kenafake, Annie Monks, Antionette O'Brien, Chris Lego, Karenza Ebejer, Matt O'Brien, Michelle Gilroy, Paul Walker, Scott Sinclair, Stefanie Miriklis.\n \nDon't miss this opportunity to experience the energy and output of this dynamic group of artists.",

Visitors can view this exhibition during the Museum's opening hours. Visits outside these times can be arranged by appointment by phoning ahead.  \n\nThe This Here Then Now project was conceived by Arts Upper Hunter and developed in partnership with local museums.

He likes the word country because it's got a rude word in it if you EMPHasise it properly. \n \nDead Set Country is Lawrence's brand new hit show that's all about a city boy gone bush. Roughed up by locals, mourning dead wombats, talking with horses and having an abiding affair with a tractor - in short Mooney is Dead Set Country.  \n\nFollowing on from the acclaim for his past three shows Beauty, Embracing Your Limitations and Pigeonhole he's back with Dead Set Country. This time he's covered in dust, speaking slower and line dancing.   \n\nIt's Clarkson's Farm meets Lawrence Mooney's head on collision with country Australia. \"You're not from round here are ya mister?\"",

        "description": "Dog Drawing in Lennox Head isn't your average life drawing session. It's a fun, hands-on opportunity to meet a new furry friend each week—dogs who are more than happy to be the centre of attention (and yes, they accept treats and scratches as payment).\n\nSpaces are limited, and all skill levels are welcome!\n\nThe class is BYO drinks, but art supplies and a grazing board are supplied and easygoing music sets the tone.\n\nEach class features a different canine model, offering a delightful variety of breeds, shapes, and personalities. From smooshy snouts to elegant limbs and enthusiastic tail-waggers, participants can try their hand at fast sketches or take a more refined approach with guided, timed exercises. Local artist Christina leads the session, offering tips and tricks across different media including charcoal, watercolours, and scratchboard.\n\nThe atmosphere is intentionally relaxed and welcoming. Guests are encouraged to move freely, interact with the dog, and connect with fellow artists. It's not just about drawing—it's about capturing character, sparking creativity, and enjoying a playful, social space. Sharing sketches is encouraged, and seeing each participant's unique take on the week's pup is half the fun.\n\nNew faces (both human and canine) are always welcome. Participants can even nominate their own dog to be the star of an upcoming class by simply popping the pup's name into the draw.",

Main streets close, local businesses dress up and people meander throughout the town centre soaking up the atmosphere. \n\nThe final weekend marks the day of the Float Parade with more than 100 floats down Grafton’s Prince Street.",

Featuring original works created for the audience's entertainment and enjoyment, it invites attendees to join these artists in celebrating creativity and expression.\n\nThe event will be held at Lithgow's best-kept secret cafe and gallery, The Old Lithgow Pottery, for music and song, poetry and stories... and to enjoy the convivial atmosphere accompanied by a tea, coffee or chai, and a selection of yummy treats.\n\nThe show is for everyone who enjoys soaking in the essence of Underground Berlin, hidden within the 7 Valleys of Lithgow. Our space has drawn comparisons to the vibrant cultural scenes of underground Berlin and the Seine River Paris.\n\nPieces of Pottery shows are presented on the 3rd Sunday of every month.",

Through a series of underwater ocean scapes, this exhibition draws attention to the urgent need to protect the oceans and celebrates the deep, ancestral relationship Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples hold with the sea.\n\nGuided by the 2025 NAIDOC Week theme, The Next Generation: Strength, Vision and Legacy, this exhibition honours the enduring custodianship of Sea Country—past, present, and future. It recognises the strength of First Nations communities in continuing this care, the vision required to heal and protect these ecosystems, and the legacy being built for generations to come.\n\nHaving experienced the beauty of the Great Barrier Reef firsthand, the artist shares a vision of preservation and interconnectedness.\n\nSea Country is both a visual celebration and a call to action—one that amplifies the role of young leaders in carrying forward a deep cultural responsibility to protect the ocean, its creatures, and the stories it holds.",

        "description": "In this interactive video installation a year's worth of seasonal flowers bloom over the course of an hour, continuously scattering and changing.\n\nFlowers are born, bloom, then in the course of time, they wither and die. The flowers are eternally repeating the process of life and death. \n\nThe artwork is not a pre-recorded image that is played back: it is created by a computer program that continuously renders the work in real time. The interaction between people and the installation causes continuous change in the artwork.\n\nIn spring in the Kunisaki Peninsula, there are many cherry blossoms in the mountains and canola blossoms at their base. It is a place of great serenity and contentment, but the expansive body of flowers is an ecosystem influenced by human intervention, and the boundary between the work of nature and the work of humans is unclear. Rather than nature and humans being in conflict, a healthy ecosystem is one that includes people. In the past, people understood that they could not grasp nature in its entirety, and that it is not possible to control nature. teamLab believe that these valleys hold faint traces of this premodern relationship with nature that once existed, and we hope to explore a form of human intervention based on the premise that nature cannot be controlled.",

        "description": "The Beatle Boys are back in 2025 with an exciting new show celebrating the 60th anniversary of Rubber Soul, The Beatles’ revolutionary 1965 album. Hailed as a turning point in their career, Rubber Soul featured iconic tracks like “Norwegian Wood” “Michelle” and “In My Life” blending innovative lyrics and instrumentation. The album spent six weeks atop the UK Albums Chart and is ranked #5 on Rolling Stone’s “500 Greatest Albums of All Time.”\n\nHonouring this milestone, The Beatle Boys recreate Rubber Soul along with a selection of hits spanning 1962 to 1969. Combining vintage instruments, meticulous detail, and stunning visuals, their show transcends a traditional concert, delivering an immersive, time-traveling experience.\n\nFor over 15 years, The Beatle Boys—John Kater, Maddy Breen, Rod Auld, and Michael Carpenter—have thrilled global audiences, from Canada to South Africa, with their energetic and authentic performances. Music historian Glenn A. Baker describes them as “impressive with their deft grasp of the Fab Four’s entire span.” Fans agree, calling the tribute “absolutely brilliant” and “pure nostalgia.”\n\nJohn Kater, portraying Paul McCartney, reflects: “The Beatles’ music remains timeless. We’re excited to celebrate Rubber Soul, an album that redefined music forever.” Whether you’re a lifelong fan or new to the Fab Four, this show is a must-see celebration of music history.",

        "description": "Iconic star of stage and screen John Waters, featuring Stewart D’Arrietta and the Chartbusters, celebrates the songs of the British Pop Invasion that changed the world of modern music forever.\n\nFrom the evocative strains of Peter Saarstedt’s Where Do You Go to My Lovely, and the memory dredging Waterloo Sunset by the Kinks and To Love Somebody by the BeeGees, to the infectious grooves of Itchycoo Park by the Small Faces and the anthemic My Generation by The Who, Waters and his band reprise and reinvent the classic hits. With a six piece band and singers in brilliant voice, Waters recounts anecdotes and moving memories of the music of the era, taking the audience through the time continuum to songs that resound over decades, and remain as relevant as ever.\n\nBorn in London, Waters was in his teens and early twenties during the 1960s and considers himself one of the luckiest music lovers as a result. The reason why is in part due to Radio Luxembourg. At a time when commercial radio licences were not available in the UK, pop and rock music of the day was broadcast from continental Europe. This access was courtesy of the independent principality of Luxembourg - a clever move by the British record industry to circumnavigate the laws of the day.",

        "description": "As young twenty-something-year-olds, Choirboys formed in 1978, growing up on Sydney’s Northern Beaches. The wild, hedonistic lifestyle the band witnessed of the youth in the 70s is ultimately what gave birth to their seminal rock anthem, Run To Paradise. It’s all about the stories that sound all too familiar within the culture widely assumed of the music industry - “sex, drugs, and rock ‘n’ roll” and they tell it all.\n\nRun To Paradise is a “spilling of the beans” of sorts. It’s part story, part song that chronicles through some of the wildest, most risqué, outrageous, and downright hilarious stories of Australian Rock. All, as these Oz pub-rock icons recall it.\n\nAnd behind the narrative are the classic songs that define the musical landscape of rock music in the ’70s and 80s, including Deep Purple’s “Smoke On The Water”, Chuck Berry’s ‘Never Can Tell’, TMG’s ‘Jump In My Car’, Dragon’s ‘Are You Old Enough’, AC/DC’s ‘Long Way To The Top’ and of course the Choirboys hits ‘Boys will Be Boys’ ‘Never Gonna Die’ ‘Struggletown’ and the pub-rock anthem ‘Run to Paradise’, to name a few.",

        "description": "Wendy Sharpe's House of Ghosts exhibition at Norman Lindsay Gallery features ephemeral wall paintings, oil paintings, works on paper, light installations and more.\n\nThe concept of ghosts and the afterlife appears in almost every culture. House of Ghosts explores the intersection of the real and the imagined – the seen and unseen, Imagined figures, spirits, ghosts, memories of people, or some kind of hallucination.\nNorman Lindsay's beloved older brother, Reg was killed on the western front in France in 1916. Norman was inconsolable. Consequently, he became interested in spiritualism, including the use of a Ouija board to contact his brother, and this created a rift within the Lindsay family.\n\nWendy Sharpe imagines Norman walking around his house, in a state of grief and longing.\n\nThe theme has a deep connection to Sharpe's own family background. Her grandmother Bessie and her sister Anne were both psychic and were followers of Madam Blavatsky (1831- 1891), a Russian occultist and philosopher. Great-aunt Anne was a well-known psychic and medium in her day, who gave public readings and performances in Russia and the UK.",

This set the wheels in motion for what has become a very rich and enduring touring history with over twelve years on the world stage, performing to well over half a million enthusiastic patrons in over thirty countries, who have aptly described Andrews’ performance as “fantastic” “brilliant” “the real deal” and “a real showman”. Greg Andrew and his band pay homage to Elton John in his two-hour concert production, which takes its name from one of the British singer-songwriter's most-loved tracks – \"Rocketman\".\n\nRocketman in Concert - On Reflection Tour celebrates the Greatest Hits from the Elton John and Bernie Taupin collection!

The works invite urban audiences to consider the desert’s mystical, sacred and environmental importance.\n\n\"The Red Centre holds a unique position in the psyche and mythology of all Australians. These paintings enable you to journey with me as I connect with nature and explore the majesty and extremes of the desert.\"\n\nLoxton continues \"Like many desert pilgrims before me, the unfamiliar environment of the desert brought me face-to-face with my vulnerability. The ancient landforms and spaciousness of the place confronted me with my own fragility, the limits of my capacity and ultimately, my finiteness. I encountered silence and space, the gentle, faithful companionship of the earth, the creatures, and trees.\n\nPainting en plein air in that environment seemed imperative, a deeply personal journey, a pilgrimage of the soul. The works on exhibit pay homage to nature’s knowing, abiding spirit, and human experiences of struggle, endurance, and hope in that environment.\"",

Both the cathedral and hall were designed by one of Australia's most famous architects, Edmund T. Blacket. \n\nThe tower was built and bells installed as per the original design in 1988 as a Bicentennial project.

The term horizons can indicate limitlessness, opportunity and optimism, or, conversely, be seen as a perceived barrier, feared sense of the unknown, or a warning sign. The exhibition embraces the breadth of these interpretations, looking at the ways we desire to draw close to the environment while also acknowledging the constructed physical, digital and mental barriers created between humankind and the landscape.\n\nThe idea of horizons as moments of precipice, meeting, or confrontation with the more-than-human worlds is investigated through the diverse and innovative practices of leading Australian artists living and working across Australia. The exhibition presents works by artists Gemma Brown, Rowan Conroy, Marian Drew, Lizzie Hall, Bianca Hester, Janet Laurence, Guido Maestri, Mandy Quadrio and Isadora Vaughan. Horizons features a dynamic range of media including ceramics, audio-visual works, photography, painting and installations.\n\nThe impactful works featured in Horizons will look at human intervention in the natural world in order to consider historic moments of destruction, contend with our present, and posit possible futures.",

For your timed result to be recorded, register once for free and bring a copy of your unique barcode with you when you turn up to park run.\n\nParkrun is not a race, but a relaxed, friendly activity - run with your pram, run with your dog, run with friends, run to beat your last run! Parkrun is sweeping Australia, and the Parkrun community is very social - participants are all invited to catch up after the run for a coffee.\n\nThe course is run on a mixture of concrete paths, bitumen paths and grass. Some sections of the course may accumulate mud, leaves and puddles after rain. Depending on availability, marshals will be at key sections of the course, or signs will be in place.\n\nOccurs every Saturday rain hail or shine.

Through a refined process that combines relief printing with watercolour, she brings to life the rugged contours, foliage, and rocky terrain of these highland environments.\n\nWorking in varying scales, Gladdish's pieces are unified by their vibrant colour, expert composition, and textural richness. Her ability to balance stark print forms with delicate painterly gestures creates a unique visual language that will appeal to lovers of both printmaking and the natural world.",

        "description": "Throughout 2024, Dungog artist Helene Leane created an exhibition inspired by a beautifully ornate National Cash Register from the Dungog Museum’s collection. The resulting exhibit, Bing Bang Ring. Cash is King! is now on display, showcasing Helene’s vibrant interpretation of this historical piece.\n\nThis project is part of This Here Then Now, an Arts Upper Hunter program developed in partnership with local museums. In 2024, three Upper Hunter regional museums collaborated with resident artists: Sophie Cox at Scone Museum, Helene Leane at Dungog Museum, and Todd Fuller at Tocal Homestead. The project was made possible through the Australian Government’s Regional Arts Fund, the NSW Government, and the C B Alexander Foundation.\n\nAt the heart of Helene’s exhibition is the cash register, originally a centrepiece at Skillen’s grocery shop (now the Dungog Medical Centre). The shop served the community until 1966, when Australia transitioned to decimal currency. Inspired by the consumer culture of that era, Helene reimagined products once sold at Skillen’s and other local shops as Pop Art-style posters. She also collected photographs of Dungog’s historic shops and community members, transforming them into bold, modern pieces that celebrate the town’s retail history.\n\nThese dynamic works are on display at the Dungog Museum. Please call the Museum if you wish to view by appointment.  Visitors can visit Helene’s Gallery on Dowling, located just across the road.",

        "description": "With sold out tours across Australia and New Zealand, Bloom is highly applauded as “one of Australia’s finest vocalists”, some even placing her in the same company, vocally, of those very artists she pays tribute to in her stage productions ‘Adele &amp; Amy Winehouse Songbook’ and the ‘Stevie Nicks, Carole King &amp; Linda Ronstadt Songbook’. Bloom now extends her focus toward another soulful musical powerhouse – Eva Cassidy.\n\nEva’s soul-stirring voice came to prominence in 1998 after her renditions of “Fields of Gold” and “Over the Rainbow” were released… two years after her passing.\n\nSadly, her inability to be signed by a record label, unsure of how to market her eclectic repertoire, meant Eva only released one solo album in her lifetime – Live at Blues Alley – an album she recorded and self-released in 1996. It wasn’t until 1998 that her posthumously released recordings would pique the interest of the small West Coast folk music label Blix Street Records. Her first posthumously released album “Songbird”, became a major international hit and earnt the songstress subsequent number one albums across the globe, selling in excess of 12 million sales worldwide.\n\nBloom will once again enthral audiences across the country in this intimate and acoustic performance featuring all of Eva’s hits including “Songbird” “Time After Time” “Fields of Gold” “Over The Rainbow” and many more.",

        "description": "Iconic star of stage and screen John Waters, featuring Stewart D’Arrietta and the Chartbusters, celebrates the songs of the British Pop Invasion that changed the world of modern music forever.\n\nFrom the evocative strains of Peter Saarstedt’s Where Do You Go to My Lovely, and the memory dredging Waterloo Sunset by the Kinks and To Love Somebody by the BeeGees, to the infectious grooves of Itchycoo Park by the Small Faces and the anthemic My Generation by The Who, Waters and his band reprise and reinvent the classic hits. With a six piece band and singers in brilliant voice, Waters recounts anecdotes and moving memories of the music of the era, taking the audience through the time continuum to songs that resound over decades, and remain as relevant as ever.\n\nBorn in London, Waters was in his teens and early twenties during the 1960s and considers himself one of the luckiest music lovers as a result. The reason why is in part due to Radio Luxembourg. At a time when commercial radio licences were not available in the UK, pop and rock music of the day was broadcast from continental Europe. This access was courtesy of the independent principality of Luxembourg - a clever move by the British record industry to circumnavigate the laws of the day.",

She suggests that accepted language and use of the word fails to remind us that this excess of water was, at one-point, fresh clean rainwater, a blessing for all living things.\n\nAs the rainwater pours in overwhelming and inconvenient quantities, it can be a shock when this water refuses to stay inside the drawn lines on maps. \n\nWatered-up by Sea… also explores the ways of spiders, and how they respond to flooding. Inspired by their actions in flood events, Satelkar asks questions with her work.",

Working in video offers artists the opportunity to use editing as their primary technique; mixing and matching elements from other films or their own work to tell new stories.\n\nBy remixing or rearranging footage they build different rhythms and moods, create hilarious juxtapositions, or shed new light on cultural cliches and presumed histories.\n\nThe works in this exhibition all demonstrate an irrepressible desire to bring deep themes to the surface with humour and an incredible attention to detail.\n\nThe collection of The Australian Centre for the Moving Image has a rich, 75-year history from its inception as the State Film Centre in 1946. Since its current incarnation in the early 2000s, the collection has expanded to include artworks and experimental film, and now holds a significant archive of complex, time-based media works and videogames, as well as an ever-expanding repository of digitised content and born-digital material.",

This set the wheels in motion for what has become a very rich and enduring touring history with over twelve years on the world stage, performing to well over half a million enthusiastic patrons in over thirty countries, who have aptly described Andrews’ performance as “fantastic” “brilliant” “the real deal” and “a real showman”. Greg Andrew and his band pay homage to Elton John in his two-hour concert production, which takes its name from one of the British singer-songwriter's most-loved tracks – \"Rocketman\".\n\nRocketman in Concert - On Reflection Tour celebrates the Greatest Hits from the Elton John and Bernie Taupin collection! Greg’s Elton John Experience will have you second guessing yourself that you’ve not seen the real Elton.",

You are invited to her experience of transition, which cannot be untied from the intergenerational haunting of deindustrialisation that reverberates across space and time.\n\nFrom within her coal house, you can bear witness to her personal struggles with haunted memories of belonging and identity. She uses collage and mixed media to bring ideas from her past, present and future into conversation with one another. This allows for the simultaneous fragmentation and re-assembly of objects of representation.\n\nExhibited alongside Emma's works will be Re-Dobell: A Community Re-imagining of Dobell and Self. This display is a selection of artworks created by community members who attended a series of workshops.\n\nThese workshops explore students' unique identities and sexualities through the fragmenting, embellishing, and reassembling of the portrait works of William Dobell.",

Truth Tell delves into the learned narratives of early colonisation and the deep impacts on Aboriginal people during this period. This powerful exhibition draws from the historical accounts of events during a time of dispossession of land and disruption to cultural practices and invites an exploration of the complexities of learned histories. \n\nDrawing inspiration from First Nations perspectives, Penny Evans, Julie Gough, Shellie Smith, James Possum Tylor and Peta Clancy uncover and re-present conflicting histories, while paying homage to the ongoing resilience and strength of Aboriginal communities.\n\nBy acknowledging the ongoing effects of colonisation, this exhibition aims to inspire conversations that foster understanding, empathy, and collective responsibility.\n\nCurated by Jasmine Kean.",

Informed by a childhood engaged with storytelling, song and dance traditions of the Wagedagam Tribe, Missi's inherited creativity, combined with his passion and experience growing up with living customary practices, prepared him for his journey into art. Missi felt the impulse to create when he first encountered the works of contemporary Torres Strait Islander artists in 1992, but it was not until 1999 that he felt ready to devote himself to artistic pursuits full-time.\n\nWith only minimal formal training on Moa Island, he rapidly worked his way to the forefront of contemporary Zenadh-Kes (Western Torres Strait) printmaking. Missi skillfully combined traditional carving techniques, iconography and his distinct fish-bone patterns with the contemporary medium of the linocut to forge a new aesthetic and print making movement in the 1990s alongside peers, an aesthetic firmly based on traditional Torres Strait Islander principles. Billy Missi gained international recognition prior to his passing in 2012.",

        "description": "A hymnal to the country under our feet.\n\nA living songbook more than four years in the making, Andrew Ford's hymnal brings together the words of sixteen contemporary Australian writers – poets, essayists, and folksingers. Born in a time of fire and darkness, grief, and loss, and then fragile, tender hope,  Red Dirt Hymns are songs of awe and praise, dedicated not to a god, but to the land. \n\n Red Dirt Hymns is performed by the ever-daring voices of Luminescence Chamber Singers alongside two rising stars: Hilary Geddes (electric guitar), 2021 Freedman Jazz Fellow and lead guitarist of Triple J favourites The Buoys, and category-defying cellist Freya Schack-Arnott. Songs that span art music, folk song, country ballad, and Aussie rock unfold to the evocative imagery of Sammy Hawker, whose art is created within the fabric of country itself: saltwater, limestone and eucalypt.\n\nFrom Ellen van Neerven's dark clouds to John Kinsella's abundant gardens, Red Dirt Hymns does what a hymnal is meant to do: it draws us closer to each other, and to the light and shade of our wide brown land.",

Meeting Queen in 2020 is the highlight of their career!\n\nKiller Queen has taken their show across the globe, including the UK, Norway, Singapore and India. In May 2019, Killer Queen performed in Russia for the first time. They have also shared the bill with the likes of Jeff Beck, Foreigner, Journey, Twisted Sister, Thin Lizzy and Kelly Rowland. \n\nJohn Blunt’s (lead singer) resemblance to Freddie Mercury is uncanny, appearing live to seven million viewers on the French TV show “Qui Sera Le Meilleur Sosie? -  Who will be the best impersonator” and John was chosen by UK’s ITV Channel 5 for the docu/drama “The Freddie Mercury Story – Who Wants to Live Forever”, a detailed look into the personal life and death of Freddie Mercury, screening in the UK, Europe and North America in 2016.\n\nThis two-hour live show consists of all Queen's Greatest Hits (and stage costumes), including Bohemian Rhapsody, We Will Rock You, We Are the Champions, Somebody to Love, Radio Ga Ga, Another One Bites the Dust and many more.\n\nThis will be an unforgettable Killer Queen Experience!",

While incarcerated, Andrew began noticing the transformative power of laughter. After all, if a joke can make you forget you’re in prison, what else can it do? \n\nUpon his release, Andrew took up stand-up comedy, initially under strict bail conditions where his parents had to come with him to shows, and he had to be home in time for curfew. \n\nA year later, Andrew performed his debut solo show ‘Jokes About the Time I Went to Prison’, at the 2023 Melbourne International Comedy Festival. Andrew’s show garnered him critical acclaim, along with a nomination for Best Newcomer.",

With a six piece band and singers in brilliant voice, Waters recounts anecdotes and moving memories of the music of the era, taking the audience through the time continuum to songs that resound over decades, and remain as relevant as ever.\n\nBorn in London, Waters was in his teens and early twenties during the 1960s and considers himself one of the luckiest music lovers as a result. The reason why is in part due to Radio Luxembourg. At a time when commercial radio licences were not available in the UK, pop and rock music of the day was broadcast from continental Europe. This access was courtesy of the independent principality of Luxembourg - a clever move by the British record industry to circumnavigate the laws of the day.",

The wild, hedonistic lifestyle the band witnessed of the youth in the 70s is ultimately what gave birth to their seminal rock anthem, Run To Paradise. It’s all about the stories that sound all too familiar within the culture widely assumed of the music industry - “sex, drugs, and rock ‘n’ roll” and they tell it all.\n\nRun To Paradise is a “spilling of the beans” of sorts. It’s part story, part song that chronicles through some of the wildest, most risqué, outrageous, and downright hilarious stories of Australian Rock. All, as these Oz pub-rock icons recall it.\n\nAnd behind the narrative are the classic songs that define the musical landscape of rock music in the ’70s and 80s, including Deep Purple’s “Smoke On The Water”, Chuck Berry’s ‘Never Can Tell’, TMG’s ‘Jump In My Car’, Dragon’s ‘Are You Old Enough’, AC/DC’s ‘Long Way To The Top’ and of course the Choirboys hits ‘Boys will Be Boys’ ‘Never Gonna Die’ ‘Struggletown’ and the pub-rock anthem ‘Run to Paradise’, to name a few.",

Baffling his Dutch contemporaries and the casual tourists in Madrid's Prado in equal measure (not to mention generations of art critics) Bosch's Garden of Earthly Delights is ever-enigmatic. Whether it is interpreted as a surreal feast for the senses or as a stark warning about the moral decay during a time of rapid change, this art exudes dread and seduction in equal measure.&nbsp;\n\nTrust Luminescence Chamber Singers to turn this surreal feast of the senses into an aural tapestry as pleasurable and perilous as Bosch's vision. Drawn from the vaults of Renaissance raunch, Medieval monasterian excess and daring modern transgressions, Garden of Earthly Delights offers a vocal cornucopia of surprise and surreptitiously cheeky delight, probing the pleasures and perils of excess.\n\nProgram to include music by Josquin, Banchieri, Gallus and new works by Nicole Murphy and Archie Tulk.",

        "description": "No one quite embodies the charm, the versatility, the dynamic charisma, and be able to recreate the flamboyant stage show of Sir Elton John, quite like Greg Andrew.\n\nWith blindingly accurate and faithful recreations of Elton’s greatest hits, combined with his effortless melodic skills and reputation as a virtuosic pianist, Greg’s uncanny likeness to the Rocketman himself has made him one of the most recognised Elton John performers in the world.\n\nIn 2017, Greg was hand-picked with a personal invitation as the only global Elton John tribute to perform on the world’s biggest tribute music festival stage in the UK, TRIBFEST. This set the wheels in motion for what has become a very rich and enduring touring history with over twelve years on the world stage, performing to well over half a million enthusiastic patrons in over thirty countries, who have aptly described Andrews’ performance as “fantastic” “brilliant” “the real deal” and “a real showman”. Greg Andrew and his band pay homage to Elton John in his two-hour concert production, which takes its name from one of the British singer-songwriter's most-loved tracks – \"Rocketman\".\n\nRocketman in Concert - On Reflection Tour celebrates the Greatest Hits from the Elton John and Bernie Taupin collection! Greg’s Elton John Experience will have you second guessing yourself that you’ve not seen the real Elton.",

Bookings are essential.\n\nGough Whitlam's home was intrinsically linked to his political life. As the Member of the Australian Parliament for Werriwa from 1952 to 1978, the home served as the backdrop to his service – constituents, seen approaching through the kitchen window as they walked up the driveway, were invited into the living or dining rooms to talk about their matters of concern. The home was a frequent host to political functions, celebrations of electoral victories, and sombre reflections on losses.  \n\nThe Whitlam Institute and Western Sydney University have been fortunate to get the opportunity to preserve and restore the home, and we are proud to be able to share this vital part of our national heritage with the public.\n\nArchitect : Roy H.D.

So join a race where you can bring them along to the beautiful Forest Headquarters, just north of Coopernook (between Taree and Kew). \n\nCaravans and campervans are welcome, but please note that Coopernook HQ is unpowered and does not offer a dump station.\n\n​​This is a seven-kilometre course around the beautiful Coopernook State Forest on the doorstep of the Coopernook village. The course is filled with lots of hidden secrets for you to find and have fun with. \n\n​This may be your first official trail run with your dog or you may be old pros at trail racing together. \n\nYou have options either 21.1 kilometres, 14 kilometres, 7 kilometres or a short option for beginners four kilometres.\n\n If you are just starting out in trail running or an ultra runner, this course caters for all levels and skills. You can walk the picturesque course or you can run or even race it. \n\nYour best friends have tons of energy, but it can be a new experience consistently running alongside you in a race endurance format, so pick a race that is suited to your dog's fitness level.",

Just bring whatever you're reading, ebooks, audiobooks, graphic novels, you name it, and settle in.\n\nIt all began in San Francisco back in 2012, when friends Guinevere de la Mare and Laura Gluhanich met up at a local bar to read in peaceful companionship. They loved reading, but didn't love the stress that often came with typical book clubs. So they created something different, a space to read together quietly, with no expectations, just books, friends, and maybe a drink or two.\n\nNow, that spirit is coming to Gosford, hosted at the wonderfully eclectic FunHaus Factory. Here, you can grab a drink, order some yummy food from Beaus Burgers and share what you're reading if you feel like it, and then spend an hour immersed in your book, surrounded by fellow book lovers.\n\nSilent Book Club is for everyone. It's bring your own book, and always free to attend. Whether you're a lifelong reader or just getting back into it, this is your space to relax, unplug, and connect in the real world.",

        "description": "Iconic star of stage and screen John Waters, featuring Stewart D’Arrietta and the Chartbusters, celebrates the songs of the British Pop Invasion that changed the world of modern music forever.\n\nFrom the evocative strains of Peter Saarstedt’s Where Do You Go to My Lovely, and the memory dredging Waterloo Sunset by the Kinks and To Love Somebody by the BeeGees, to the infectious grooves of Itchycoo Park by the Small Faces and the anthemic My Generation by The Who, Waters and his band reprise and reinvent the classic hits. With a six piece band and singers in brilliant voice, Waters recounts anecdotes and moving memories of the music of the era, taking the audience through the time continuum to songs that resound over decades, and remain as relevant as ever.\n\nBorn in London, Waters was in his teens and early twenties during the 1960s and considers himself one of the luckiest music lovers as a result. The reason why is in part due to Radio Luxembourg. At a time when commercial radio licences were not available in the UK, pop and rock music of the day was broadcast from continental Europe. This access was courtesy of the independent principality of Luxembourg - a clever move by the British record industry to circumnavigate the laws of the day.",

        "description": "The Beatle Boys are back in 2025 with an exciting new show celebrating the 60th anniversary of Rubber Soul, The Beatles’ revolutionary 1965 album. Hailed as a turning point in their career, Rubber Soul featured iconic tracks like “Norwegian Wood” “Michelle” and “In My Life” blending innovative lyrics and instrumentation. The album spent six weeks atop the UK Albums Chart and is ranked #5 on Rolling Stone’s “500 Greatest Albums of All Time.”\n\nHonouring this milestone, The Beatle Boys recreate Rubber Soul along with a selection of hits spanning 1962 to 1969. Combining vintage instruments, meticulous detail, and stunning visuals, their show transcends a traditional concert, delivering an immersive, time-traveling experience.\n\nFor over 15 years, The Beatle Boys—John Kater, Maddy Breen, Rod Auld, and Michael Carpenter—have thrilled global audiences, from Canada to South Africa, with their energetic and authentic performances. Music historian Glenn A. Baker describes them as “impressive with their deft grasp of the Fab Four’s entire span.” Fans agree, calling the tribute “absolutely brilliant” and “pure nostalgia.”\n\nJohn Kater, portraying Paul McCartney, reflects: “The Beatles’ music remains timeless. We’re excited to celebrate Rubber Soul, an album that redefined music forever.” Whether you’re a lifelong fan or new to the Fab Four, this show is a must-see celebration of music history.",

By its very nature, it cross-pollinates. Moving through disciplines – graphic, furniture and product design, fashion and the visual arts – it manifests as surface patterning, material experimentation and transfiguration, storytelling and conceptual ideas.\n\nDespite the hardships of recent years, Australian textile-based practices are flourishing. Makers are finding renewed confidence in community-driven interest, co-creation, and inclusivity. Collaborations in the fashion industry are on the increase, forged by creatives such as Romance Was Born, Iordanes Spyridon Gogos, Grace Lillian Lee and initiatives such as First Nations Fashion + Design. \n\nThe skyrocketing visibility within First Nations practices is partly due to the passionate vision of new enterprises and reinforced by the meaningful and covetable textile designs being produced by artists in the Top End and remote art centres and collectives. In line with these developments, and urgent sustainability concerns, the artisanal ethos is gaining agency.\n\nNew Exuberance celebrates the work of more than 30 textile creatives and includes 10 commissioned furniture pieces produced by designers associated with JamFactory to acknowledge the rich diversity of textile-based practices in contemporary art, design and fashion in this country now.",

Banished from school (again), he's sent on an epic quest to find Zeus' missing lightning bolt and prevent a war among the gods. Packed with monsters, mayhem, and a killer rock score, The Lightning Thief is a fast-paced adventure that captures the imagination of audiences of all ages.\n\nAudiences can expect to see themes of neurodiversity and diversity shine through in a story that speaks to young people with courage, humour, and empathy. Whether you're a die-hard Percy Jackson fan or new to the world of gods and demigods, this is a show that promises laughter, thrills, unforgettable music — and a theatre experience like no other.",

Her little brother, Joey, tells her kangaroos don't dance, they hop - but Josephine continues to point her toes and leap through the air. When a ballet troupe comes to the sleepy town of Shaggy Gully, Josephine desperately wants to dance like the ballerinas in pink tutus and silk ballet shoes.\n\nOn the day of the first performance the Ballet Company is in trouble. The prima ballerina twists her ankle and the understudy has a splinter in her toe. Who can dance the lead role? Josephine's talents are called upon to help save the day. Can she do it, and more importantly, does it matter that she's a kangaroo?\n\nRecommended for ages 4–9 and their families. \n\nRunning time 50 minutes, no interval. Times are approximate and subject to change without notice.",

Tolkien, with his Symphony No. 5 Return to Middle Earth. Although there are some thematic reminiscences of his monumental first symphony, The Lord of the Rings from 1988, De Meij puts a completely different musical vibe into this new symphony. \n\nThere is an important role for a solo soprano and a mixed choir: they sing in Ilkorin, one of the Elvish languages of Middle-Earth. The ensemble welcomes Sara Carvalho as soloist in this great new work.\n\nProgram:\nJohann de Meij\nSymphony No 5 'Return to Middle Earth' for Wind Orchestra, Soprano Soloist and Choir\n\nImages: \nFernleigh Ensemble - Lauren Moulton/Dru Maher-Brooks | J.R.R.

        "description": "With sold-out tours across Australia and New Zealand, Bloom is highly applauded as “one of Australia’s finest vocalists”, some even placing her in the same company, vocally, of those very artists she pays tribute to in her stage productions ‘Adele &amp; Amy Winehouse Songbook’ and the ‘Stevie Nicks, Carole King &amp; Linda Ronstadt Songbook’. Bloom now extends her focus toward another soulful musical powerhouse – Eva Cassidy.\n\nEva’s soul-stirring voice came to prominence in 1998 after her renditions of “Fields of Gold” and “Over the Rainbow” were released… two years after her passing.\n\nSadly, her inability to be signed by a record label, unsure of how to market her eclectic repertoire, meant Eva only released one solo album in her lifetime – Live at Blues Alley – an album she recorded and self-released in 1996. It wasn’t until 1998 that her posthumously released recordings would pique the interest of the small West Coast folk music label Blix Street Records. Her first posthumously released album “Songbird”, became a major international hit and earned the songstress subsequent number one albums across the globe, selling in excess of 12 million sales worldwide.\n\nBloom will once again enthral audiences across the country in this intimate and acoustic performance featuring all of Eva’s hits including “Songbird” “Time After Time” “Fields of Gold” “Over The Rainbow” and many more.",

Each song tells stories of his life and internal world through sweeping melodies and poetic lyrics.\n\nThe performance will include selection from Ash Morse's most recent albums: Cinematic/orchestral \"To Go Home\", nostalgic, heartfelt piano/vocal \"Family Ties\" and more joyful EP \"Sunny Haven Avenue\".\n\nAsh will also perform his unique composition \"Dream Machine\", which was partly released as a radio edit in 2023 (now available only on YouTube), reached the top 40 in the prestigious Vanda and Young international competition, and claimed the grand prize for the IYMC International Composer's competition. In the words of Brian Henderson Ward, in his ASA review \"Dream Machine\" is \"an incredible mix of melodies featuring so many key, time and mood changes. It is more complex than Bohemian Rhapsody and feels like a huge theatre production. An outstanding vocal performance along with fabulous harmonies. The musicianship was genius.\"\n\n\"Dream Machine\" is part of Ash Morse's forthcoming 2025 album \"Nowhere Land\", his biggest, and most ambitious project yet.",

The shows celebrate iconic anniversaries of significant years of music, therefore changing every year!\n\nThe first in this series is \"60 Years of 1965\". This show focuses on the music released or recorded in 1965 from all around the world. Music from a key year of social evolution, and musical styles and popular culture growing, combining and breeding new sounds and styles… characteristics that resonate, now 60 years later.\n\n1965 was a critical year in music history. The first wave of the British invasion had well and truly crashed all around the world, and American rock responded. We see a move away from simple beat music to pop music incorporating soul, blues and the first stages of the new rock music. With artists like The Beatles, the Beach Boys, The Who, The Byrds, Smokie Robinson, Tom Jones, The Kinks, The Four Tops, Bob Dylan and many many more, it proved to be a pivotal year in the move towards the psychadelia, hard rock and beyond of the late 60's.\n\nWith a 5 piece band, striking visuals and a little bit of a history lesson, The Album Show will present a showcase of as many of these iconic tracks as possible in a two set, two hour show!",

        "description": "With sold out tours across Australia and New Zealand, Bloom is highly applauded as \"one of Australia's finest vocalists\", some even placing her in the same company, vocally, of those very artists she pays tribute to in her stage productions 'Adele &amp; Amy Winehouse Songbook' and the 'Stevie Nicks, Carole King &amp; Linda Ronstadt Songbook'. \n\nBloom, also a recording artist in her own right, now extends her focus toward another soulful musical powerhouse – Eva Cassidy.\n\nEva's soul-stirring voice came to prominence in 1998 after her renditions of \"Fields of Gold\" and \"Over the Rainbow\" were released… two years after her passing, succumbing to Melanoma at age 33.\n\nSadly, her inability to be signed by a record label, unsure of how to market her eclectic repertoire, meant Eva only released one solo album in her lifetime – Live at Blues Alley – an album she recorded and self-released in 1996.  It wasn't until 1998 that her posthumously released recordings would pique the interest of the small West Coast folk music label Blix Street Records.  Her first posthumously released album \"Songbird\", became a major international hit and earnt the songstress subsequent  number one albums across the globe, selling in excess of 12 million sales worldwide.\n\nBloom will once again enthral audiences across the country in this intimate and acoustic performance featuring all of Eva's hits.",

        "description": "The Album Show returns with a new series of ever evolving shows. The shows celebrate iconic anniversaries of significant years of music, therefore changing every year!\n\nThe next in this series is \"50 Years of 1975\". This show focuses on the music released or recorded in 1975 from all around the world. Music from a key year of social evolution, and musical styles and popular culture growing, combining and breeding new sounds and styles… characteristics that resonate, now 50 years later.\n\n1975 was a critical year in music history. The smooth sounds of West Coast country rock, the high point of 70's pure pop, the dying echoes of glam, the growing wave of disco and even the stirrings of punk all were characteristics of this important year.  With artists like Captain and Tenielle, Elton John, Bee Gees, Hot Chocolate, America, Fleetwood Mac, ABBA, Eagles, The Bay City Rollers and many many more, it proved to be a pivotal year in the crystallisation of pop music.\n\nWith a 5 piece band, striking visuals and a little bit of a history lesson, The Album Show will present a showcase of as many of these iconic tracks as possible in a two set, two hour plus show!",

        "description": "Richard Clapton as one of Australia's foremost singer/songwriters, paved the way for subsequent generations of songwriters to write about the experience of being Australian.\n\nHe grew up in Sydney in the 1960s before hopping a plane for London, and then later to Germany, where he wrote a first album, Prussian Blue (1973) which was one of the first major Australian \"singer-songwriter\" albums.\n\nOne of the most popular songs from Prussian Blue was I Wanna Be A Survivor. I doubt he imagined then, how true that message would turn out to be. His songs are still omnipresent on the radio to this day; his records charting the political landscape of the nation and the turbulent lives of two generations.                                                               \n\nLike Americans Jackson Browne and Bruce Springsteen, Richard Clapton developed a sound based on melodic rock while his lyrics were poetic musings on his state of mind or the state of the nation.\n\nBy 1975, when he released his highly acclaimed, No.1 hit Girls On The Avenue, Clapton had set the themes he was to explore for the coming decades.\n\nOver the following years there were a string of hits including the perennial favourites: Capricorn Dancer, Deep Water, I Am An Island, and more.\n\nRichard mastered that most difficult of show business acts – the highwire that requires the balance of radio-friendly tunes and candid, from-the-heart, lyrics.",

        "description": "Iconic star of stage and screen John Waters, featuring Stewart D’Arrietta and the Chartbusters, celebrates the songs of the British Pop Invasion that changed the world of modern music forever.\n\nFrom the evocative strains of Peter Saarstedt’s Where Do You Go to My Lovely, and the memory dredging Waterloo Sunset by the Kinks and To Love Somebody by the BeeGees, to the infectious grooves of Itchycoo Park by the Small Faces and the anthemic My Generation by The Who, Waters and his band reprise and reinvent the classic hits. With a six-piece band and singers in brilliant voice, Waters recounts anecdotes and moving memories of the music of the era, taking the audience through the time continuum to songs that resound over decades, and remain as relevant as ever.\n\nBorn in London, Waters was in his teens and early twenties during the 1960s and considers himself one of the luckiest music lovers as a result. The reason why is in part due to Radio Luxembourg. At a time when commercial radio licences were not available in the UK, pop and rock music of the day was broadcast from continental Europe. This access was courtesy of the independent principality of Luxembourg - a clever move by the British record industry to circumnavigate the laws of the day.",

The company persuaded him to become a recording artist and he soon rose to fame as a solo singer/songwriter with his own composition, the pop ballad \"Julia\", which made the Australian charts in 1970. He followed that with \"Falling in Love Again\", a song by The Easybeats songwriting team Harry Vanda &amp; George Young, which was a major hit in 1971. Mulry was a prolific songwriter, and a number of bands and artists, including John Farnham and Alison MacCallum, recorded his songs. Most notably, rock band Sherbet had a hit with his song \"You're All Woman\".\n\nAfter getting tired of being backed by different backing bands, in 1972 he switched from acoustic guitar to bass and formed his own band, Ted Mulry Gang, with guitarist Les Hall and drummer Herman Kovac. The band released their first album Here We Are. When that album didn't do as well as expected, the record company wanted Mulry to go back to singing solo. Ronnie Clayton told them to stick to it and brought in second guitarist Gary Dixon to complete the foursome. With his own band behind him he adopted a more hard rocking style.",

Now 68 years later, his iconic career has come full circle. As the last record superstar from his era still on stage, he once again is alone. The Leemen whilst not seen, are heard on his own amazing tracks.\n\nAfter all these years, Lonnie has taken a new exciting direction for his career which focuses on that magic year of 1959, when Rock'n'Roll exploded across the world. With amazing audio visual highlights from his entire career to accompany him singing his own Gold hits as well as legendary hits of his friends, the same excitement will emanate from the stage as it always has from a Lonnie Lee show. The tracks he sings to bring back the same excitement they did back in the day.\n\nOne of the features in the show is when he talks about and sings an amazing song he wrote for Roy Orbison called 'Rain', which in the 1970's, Roy told him it would be his next #1 single.",

Participating artists from Australia and Korea delve into themes of memory, intimacy, and authenticity through this contrast, reinterpreting analogue media not as mere relics of the past but as powerful mediums for connection and introspection today.\n\nEach artwork reflects a universal human longing for the tactile, the imperfect, and the material, offering audiences a moment to pause and reflect within a fast-paced, screen-saturated era. 'Obsolete Redux' reminds us that within what is often dismissed as 'obsolete,' there remains profound emotional depth, introspection, and the enduring touch of humanity.\n\nArtists: Carolyn Craig, Damian Dillon, Han Heejoon, Hong Insook, Cecilia Kim, Julia Kim, Haejung Lee, Roy Lee, David Manley, Sangwook Moon",

        "description": "'Ukrainian DNA' is an exhibition of work by Maru Jarockyj that highlights the infusion of her Ukrainian heritage with linear blocks and coloured cubic assemblies, which are defined by symbolic Ukrainian themes. The essence of this art lies in the purity of its lines and cutting blocks of colour. Together, these form a unique painting style that is inspired by both modernism and cubism, at the same time embracing Ukrainian heritage and bold architectural influences at the same time. \n\nAs a practising architect, Maru's fascination with abstraction, geometry and fragmented forms has been an enduring constant of her work which spills onto the canvas in a symphony of eclectic lines. These lines, which reflect strands of strong Ukrainian DNA, symbolically represent the cultural links tied to a deep sense of self: a mystic multicultural identity that Australian Ukrainians draw upon while living in the diaspora.\n\nSharing art and culture makes communities stronger, more resilient, and the work featured in Ukrainian DNA will reinforce the idea (in these horrific times for Ukraine) that Art gives us a voice, gives us optimism and hope. The significant Ukrainian-Australian community living in Sydney is fiercely proud of its heritage and will always harness its creative Ukrainian DNA for the triumph of truth.",

        "title": "CASA / HOUSE: Interior of Abstract Memories",
        "description": "A solo exhibition by Gaia Starace, 'CASA / HOUSE:' is an immersive body of abstract work that invites the viewer into a space of memory, emotion, and interiority. Rooted in the idea of home as both a physical and psychological sanctuary, the exhibition unfolds like a domestic dream — soft, unstable, and deeply personal.\n\nThe word 'casa' — house — becomes a lens to examine the layered interplay between past and present, memory and space, fragility and strength. Within this imagined interior, a soft baby doll pink permeates the environment, acting as both a visual and emotional cue. Scattered prompts — like a cardboard, old-fashioned telephone recalling long conversations filled with laughter and confidences shared with a childhood friend, or a delicate coffee table resembling dollhouse furniture — evoke a sense of playful nostalgia. These elements gently remind us of the impermanence of material things and the intimacy of remembered moments. Within this space, the abstract paintings serve as emotional anchors. Created through an intuitive, process-based approach, each piece reflects not an object or a scene, but a felt experience — a gesture toward a moment, a colour that lingers like a memory. These compositions act like rooms within a house of feeling: layered, quiet, and open to interpretation.\n\nImage: Gaia Starace, 'Casa-House', 2025, mix media and digital design",

Who is selected? Who is overlooked? Are the judging criteria truly inclusive? \n\nThis exhibition brings those voices to the forefront. Curated by the influential artist and curator Shen Jiawei, There is a Platform Called Archibald features works by prominent Chinese-Australian artists who have either been finalists in the Archibald or have created works that respond to its legacy. These portraits — some celebrated, others overlooked — offer an invitation to rethink how we define value in portraiture. After all, art is not governed by a single standard.\n\nThe works on display explore themes such as the deconstruction of identity, reimagining cultural hybridity, and subtle critiques of systemic bias. These portraits offer rich, complex, and deeply human narratives, encouraging viewers to reconsider the traditional definitions of portraiture and reflect on the diverse stories that make up Australian identity.",

Reflecting on his first show and Lloyd Reese's encouraging comment that he should continue working in the \"high country\", he now sees that advice as having truly come to pass.\n\nDaniel Pata is represented in major Public Collections in Australia and internationally, including the Gosford Regional Gallery Collection, NSW; Sturt University, NSW; National Gallery of Australia, Canberra, ACT; St Peter's College, Oxford University, UK, and numerous Corporate and Private collections in Australia, Europe, USA.",

The wild, hedonistic lifestyle the band witnessed of the youth in the 70s is ultimately what gave birth to their seminal rock anthem, Run To Paradise. It’s all about the stories that sound all too familiar within the culture widely assumed of the music industry - “sex, drugs, and rock ‘n’ roll” and they tell it all.\n\nRun To Paradise is a “spilling of the beans” of sorts. It’s part story, part song that chronicles through some of the wildest, most risqué, outrageous, and downright hilarious stories of Australian Rock. All, as these Oz pub-rock icons recall it.\n\nBehind the narrative are the classic songs that define the musical landscape of rock music in the ’70s and '80s, including Deep Purple’s “Smoke On The Water”, Chuck Berry’s ‘Never Can Tell’, TMG’s ‘Jump In My Car’, Dragon’s ‘Are You Old Enough’, AC/DC’s ‘Long Way To The Top’ and of course, the Choirboys hits ‘Boys Will Be Boys’ ‘Never Gonna Die’ ‘Struggletown’ and the pub-rock anthem ‘Run to Paradise’, to name a few.",

        "description": "With sold out tours across Australia and New Zealand, Bloom is highly applauded as “one of Australia’s finest vocalists”, some even placing her in the same company, vocally, of those very artists she pays tribute to in her stage productions ‘Adele &amp; Amy Winehouse Songbook’ and the ‘Stevie Nicks, Carole King &amp; Linda Ronstadt Songbook’. Bloom now extends her focus toward another soulful musical powerhouse – Eva Cassidy.\n\nEva’s soul-stirring voice came to prominence in 1998 after her renditions of “Fields of Gold” and “Over the Rainbow” were released… two years after her passing.\n\nSadly, her inability to be signed by a record label, unsure of how to market her eclectic repertoire, meant Eva only released one solo album in her lifetime – Live at Blues Alley – an album she recorded and self-released in 1996. It wasn’t until 1998 that her posthumously released recordings would pique the interest of the small West Coast folk music label Blix Street Records. Her first posthumously released album “Songbird”, became a major international hit and earned the songstress subsequent number one albums across the globe, selling in excess of 12 million sales worldwide.\n\nBloom will once again enthral audiences across the country in this intimate and acoustic performance featuring all of Eva’s hits including “Songbird” “Time After Time” “Fields of Gold” “Over The Rainbow” and many more.",

Run by soul, funk, and RnB musician Bek Jensen, the choir preaches an all-welcome philosophy, not just singing ability but all ages, gender and culture too. Each session is a two-hour affair featuring a different song each time, with Jensen taking you through some vocal warm-ups before leading the group to sing in harmony.\n\nThe pop-in choir runs monthly on the Central Coast and once every three months in Sydney. Check the socials for details for event dates or to know what song is coming up in the next session.",

Whether it is interpreted as a surreal feast for the senses or as a stark warning about the moral decay during a time of rapid change, this art exudes dread and seduction in equal measure.&nbsp;\n\nTrust Luminescence Chamber Singers to turn this surreal feast of the senses into an aural tapestry as pleasurable and perilous as Bosch's vision. Drawn from the vaults of Renaissance raunch, Medieval monasterian excess and daring modern transgressions, Garden of Earthly Delights offers a vocal cornucopia of surprise and surreptitiously cheeky delight, probing the pleasures and perils of excess.\n\nProgram to include music by Josquin, Banchieri, Gallus and new works by Nicole Murphy and Archie Tulk.",

A partnership between the Justice and Equity Centre and the UNSW Indigenous Law Centre, Towards Truth shows how laws and government decisions have impacted First Nations people since colonisation began. Bold in scope and forensic in execution, Towards Truth is changing how we understand our history and the Australian colonial project.\n\nBefore the talk, attendees are invited to a private viewing of the Seeing Sydney, Knowing Country exhibition between 5pm and 5.45pm.

The live show combines theatrical techniques and James' charismatic storytelling to create an evening of compelling intellectual entertainment.\n\nFrom Ice Age migrations to space travel, the stories of famous, infamous and unknown explorers will come to life in a theatric style, presented by British television presenter and award-winning journalist James May. James is best known as a co-presenter of Top Gear&nbsp;and The Grand Tour and as the host of the Our Man in… TV series.\n\nFew endeavours have captured the imagination and spirit of humanity as profoundly as exploration. Audiences will embark on an awe-inspiring journey through time and space. They will discover the stories of those who risked (and sometimes gave) everything, driven by insatiable curiosity and an unquenchable thirst for discovery, pushing back the boundaries of the unexplored regions of the world, and now, the universe.\n\nJames May will unravel the breathtaking tales of humankind from the earliest wanderings of ancient hunter-gatherers to the intrepid, often obsessive explorers, among them Lief Ericson, John Cabot, James Cook's navigator Tupaia, Stanley and Livingstone, Gertrude Bell, through to the moon walkers, space exploration and the seemingly impossible challenges of interplanetary and intergalactic travel.",

Uncovering stories from across the decades of how we have been sold and realised ideas of home, Tim looks at why Australians have chased home ownership and explores some of the unique and special ways we have built in this place.  \n\nWe are a nation that is undeniably fixated on property, but increasingly, the headlines are about housing scarcity, affordability and mortgage pain. For many Australians, owning a home now seems like an unattainable dream. So, what can we learn from our past to help solve the problems of the future, and how can we reimagine the Australian Dream?",

Since the late 19th century, watercolour painting has been introduced to China through Western art education. By the 21st century, Chinese watercolour art has embraced new trends such as cross-media experimentation, material innovation, and the integration of digital technologies.\n\nIn the ongoing interplay between tradition and modernity, and between local and global perspectives, Chinese watercolour has undergone continuous transformation, achieving constant renewal and breakthroughs. Rooted in the rich soil of Chinese cultural heritage, it also actively absorbs and integrates international artistic languages, preserving an Eastern aesthetic while expressing a diverse and open contemporary sensibility.\n\nThis lecture will guide the audience through the historical evolution and contemporary expressions of Chinese watercolour art. It also aims to serve as a platform for artistic dialogue and exchange between China and Australia, fostering encounters and resonance between Eastern and Western cultures through the medium of watercolour.\n\nThe Lecturer-Liu Baoxun\n\nMr Li Baoxuan, born in 1983 in Fuxin, Liaoning Provinceof China, currently holds the position of Associate Professor and Master's Supervisor at the Lu Xun Academy of Fine Arts, where he serves as Deputy Director of the Department of Watercolour Painting with the School of Painting Arts.",

        "description": "Come and experience the new exhibition showcasing  Treasures that have been donated to the Anzac Memorial from its opening in 1934. \n\nFor 90 years veterans and their families have donated objects to which they ascribe great value to the Anzac Memorial. Some of those objects are of unquestionable aesthetic and financial value. Some appear quite mundane, their significance requiring explanation and interpretation. All are treasures.\n\nThis exhibition comprises a selection of treasures of the Anzac Memorial collection. The choices were made by the curatorial and collection management staff. The selection is subjective and by no means definitive. New treasures are being donated all the time.\n\nIn 1934 Great War veteran, lawyer and author S Elliot Napier wrote of the Anzac Memorial that “as the men of 1914-1918… are gathered to the valley of the shadows” the rooms of the Memorial “will be transformed into reliquaries wherein may be placed such tributes and mementoes to the men of 1914-1918 as may be deemed appropriate. Thus will the Memorial gather to itself its full spiritual message for delivery to future generations of Australians.”\n\nThery hope that their choices have lived up to the ideals of those of Napier's generation and through their display provide examples of the courage, endurance and sacrifice of those whose lives have been touched by war from colonial times to the present day.",

Captivity at the hands of the Japanese is remembered for merciless brutality however the initial experience in some camps was not harsh. To maintain the morale of the inmates, Champion de Crespigny and others made posters and produced a magazine, Mark Time, during their time as POWs in Java.\n\nThis extraordinary collection offers a glimpse into the uncertainties of life as captives of a cruel and unpredictable enemy.\n\nThe exhibition also includes four sketches of the Japanese war crimes trials held on Morotai in December 1945, drawn by Signalman Alex King, a talented professional newspaper artist. King served with the Australian Corps of Signals and was able to observe some of the trials firsthand.\n\nThese unique original sketches capture the moment when Japanese soldiers attended makeshift courts sitting in the witness chair. They offer a rare insight into both the trial process and the individuals accused of war crimes. \n\nThe exhibition is in the Memorial's Auditorium on Lower Ground level. The Memorial is open every day. \n\nEntry is free.",

Their father, with the soul of a poet, is struggling to find the words. Then Crow arrives—strange, loud, funny, and unsettling. Part babysitter, part nuisance, part unlikely guide. Crow, like a gothic Mary Poppins, brings chaos and comfort in equal measure. Is he real? Is he imagined? Did this odd bird come to a grieving family because they needed him? Or is he something they made? \n\nProfoundly beautiful and poignant, this fresh reimagining of Porter's exquisite prose poem is not to be missed.",

Baffling his Dutch contemporaries and the casual tourists in Madrid's Prado in equal measure (not to mention generations of art critics) Bosch's Garden of Earthly Delights is ever-enigmatic. Whether it is interpreted as a surreal feast for the senses or as a stark warning about the moral decay during a time of rapid change, this art exudes dread and seduction in equal measure.&nbsp;\n\nTrust Luminescence Chamber Singers to turn this surreal feast of the senses into an aural tapestry as pleasurable and perilous as Bosch's vision. Drawn from the vaults of Renaissance raunch, Medieval monasterian excess and daring modern transgressions, Garden of Earthly Delights offers a vocal cornucopia of surprise and surreptitiously cheeky delight, probing the pleasures and perils of excess.\n\nProgram to include music by Josquin, Banchieri, Gallus and new works by Nicole Murphy and Archie Tulk.",

The markets began in 1973 as the brainchild of the late Reverend Peter Holden Rev. Holden is considered by many to be a visionary young minister who had just returned to Sydney after helping to organise the legendary Woodstock music festival.  At that time, the church community saw the markets as a way to encourage the creativity Paddington had on offer as it developed a new bohemian new identity following the recent migration of artists to the area.",

With more than 26 million album sales in the U.S. alone, it was CCR’s take on Dale Hawkins’ rockabilly classic Suzie Q that set an irrepressible force in motion and made the band a platinum household name. CCR anthems such as Proud Mary, Bad Moon Rising, Up Around The Bend, Born On The Bayou, Have You Ever Seen The Rain, Travelin’ Band and Green River will surely get the audience singing a chorus of hits.\n\nThe Kings of Country Rock Tour is the ultimate rock experience!

Known for her sparkling vocals, poetic grit, and dynamic storytelling, Cookie has toured with Mick Thomas, recorded with Tim Rogers, and shared the stage with icons like Neko Case, Kate Miller-Heidke, and Jen Cloher.\n\n\"This tour is really about reconnecting — with the music, with the audience, and with the kind of intimate, soul-nourishing shows that made me fall in love with performing in the first place\" says Cookie. \"New Zealand has been such a huge supporter of my music from afar, and this tour feels like a really special way to finally build that connection in person. In a time when so much feels fast and fleeting, I'm craving the slow magic of small rooms and real moments.\"",

        "description": "Iconic star of stage and screen John Waters, featuring Stewart D’Arrietta and the Chartbusters, celebrates the songs of the British Pop Invasion that changed the world of modern music forever.\n\nFrom the evocative strains of Peter Saarstedt’s Where Do You Go to My Lovely, and the memory dredging Waterloo Sunset by the Kinks and To Love Somebody by the BeeGees, to the infectious grooves of Itchycoo Park by the Small Faces and the anthemic My Generation by The Who, Waters and his band reprise and reinvent the classic hits. With a six piece band and singers in brilliant voice, Waters recounts anecdotes and moving memories of the music of the era, taking the audience through the time continuum to songs that resound over decades, and remain as relevant as ever.\n\nBorn in London, Waters was in his teens and early twenties during the 1960s and considers himself one of the luckiest music lovers as a result. The reason why is in part due to Radio Luxembourg. At a time when commercial radio licences were not available in the UK, pop and rock music of the day was broadcast from continental Europe. This access was courtesy of the independent principality of Luxembourg - a clever move by the British record industry to circumnavigate the laws of the day.",

While incarcerated, Andrew began noticing the transformative power of laughter. After all, if a joke can make you forget you’re in prison, what else can it do? \n\nUpon his release, Andrew took up stand-up comedy, initially under strict bail conditions where his parents had to come with him to shows, and he had to be home in time for curfew. \n\nA year later, Andrew performed his debut solo show ‘Jokes About the Time I Went to Prison’, at the 2023 Melbourne International Comedy Festival. Andrew’s show garnered him critical acclaim, along with a nomination for Best Newcomer.",

        "description": "With sold out tours across Australia and New Zealand, Bloom is highly applauded as “one of Australia’s finest vocalists”, some even placing her in the same company, vocally, of those very artists she pays tribute to in her stage productions ‘Adele &amp; Amy Winehouse Songbook’ and the ‘Stevie Nicks, Carole King &amp; Linda Ronstadt Songbook’. Bloom now extends her focus toward another soulful musical powerhouse – Eva Cassidy.\n\nEva’s soul-stirring voice came to prominence in 1998 after her renditions of “Fields of Gold” and “Over the Rainbow” were released… two years after her passing.\n\nSadly, her inability to be signed by a record label, unsure of how to market her eclectic repertoire, meant Eva only released one solo album in her lifetime – Live at Blues Alley – an album she recorded and self-released in 1996. It wasn’t until 1998 that her posthumously released recordings would pique the interest of the small West Coast folk music label Blix Street Records. Her first posthumously released album “Songbird”, became a major international hit and earnt the songstress subsequent number one albums across the globe, selling in excess of 12 million sales worldwide.\n\nBloom will once again enthral audiences across the country in this intimate and acoustic performance featuring all of Eva’s hits including “Songbird” “Time After Time” “Fields of Gold” “Over The Rainbow” and many more.",

Baffling his Dutch contemporaries and the casual tourists in Madrid's Prado in equal measure (not to mention generations of art critics) Bosch's Garden of Earthly Delights is ever-enigmatic. Whether it is interpreted as a surreal feast for the senses or as a stark warning about the moral decay during a time of rapid change, this art exudes dread and seduction in equal measure.&nbsp;\n\nTrust Luminescence Chamber Singers to turn this surreal feast of the senses into an aural tapestry as pleasurable and perilous as Bosch's vision. Drawn from the vaults of Renaissance raunch, Medieval monasterian excess and daring modern transgressions, Garden of Earthly Delights offers a vocal cornucopia of surprise and surreptitiously cheeky delight, probing the pleasures and perils of excess.\n\nProgram to include music by Josquin, Banchieri, Gallus and new works by Nicole Murphy and Archie Tulk.",

        "description": "Resist the System brings together two major artworks from Karla Dickens. Return to Sender is an installation that reworks a collection of found postcards picturing First Nations people from the turn of last century. Wiradjuri artist Karla Dickens confronts these racist greetings with messages of strength and survival. This celebrated work will be exhibited alongside Criminalised, a new commission created especially for Shoalhaven Regional Gallery, that challenges the criminalisation of young Black children. The artist has sewn and decorated black balaclavas, typically associated with concealing the identity of a criminals, to create a new photographic series with young First Nation children from her neighbourhood on Bundjalung Country, NSW.  \n\nKarla Dickens is a Wiradjuri artist whose work spans sculpture, textiles, poetry, painting, photography, and found material collage. Drawing on her Indigenous heritage and experiences as a single mother, Dickens's work uncovers hidden aspects of Australia's past and ongoing relationship with its Indigenous peoples. Using a range of methods and materials, her work celebrates and critiques historical figures and practices, interprets histories of institutionalisation and dispossession, and communicates the ongoing discrimination, oppression, and socio-cultural repercussions of colonialism experienced by Australians of Indigenous descent. Karla's work has been included in the Biennale of Sydney, the Asia Pacific Triennial and numerous prestigious exhibitions in Australia and around the world.",

The surrounding empty space represents a pathway toward an unknown future which like a stone thrown into the water ripples outwards through multiple understandings, perspectives and communities.\n\nAs the painting evolved, the form of a woven basket emerged, representing the interwoven histories of the community and the contribution made by collaborative art practice. Embedded into the fabric of the basket is representation of both the Aboriginal Flag and the Union Jack to illustrate the Aboriginal and Non-Aboriginal community that makes up the fabric of the Shoalhaven region.  \n\nThe missing elements of the painting are deliberate asking the audience to reflect on the unfinished process of reconciliation.",

        "description": "Chick Butcher returns to Sevenmarks  with a Sculptural Reckoning on Loss and Presence.\n\nSevenmarks  Gallery is proud to present Where Thought Settles, a potent new solo exhibition by contemporary artist, Chick Butcher. \n\nOpening 12 July, 2025 in Kiama, this marks Butcher's second major presentation within the gallery he co-founded—and it lands with presence.\n\nWorking with timber, glass and Corten steel, Butcher builds a sculptural language of weight and restraint. The materials carry a visceral presence—darkened wood holds the scent of fire and time, while glass surfaces reflect with veiled precision. Each work is pared back, exacting and quiet, inviting close attention rather than spectacle.\n\nIn Where Thought Settles, Butcher gives form to what lingers —where mass meets memory and absence becomes its own kind of monument. These objects don't speak loudly, they resonate. Still, grounded and contemplative, they hold space as much as they occupy it.\n\nAt a time when contemporary art often mirrors the relentless pace of the world, Where Thought Settles compels us to slow and pause. It is not simply an exhibition—it is an invitation to listen to what is felt but not said, to engage with the weight of what remains.\n\nIn resisting noise, these works speak with clarity. In their stillness they become monuments to presence, memory and the quiet truths that define our time.",

Hidden between the world of plants and animals, another world exists: ''Fungi: Web of Life. We'll begin in the mysterious world of the forest floor, where fungi are the central players in nature's story of birth, death, and rebirth to discover that life as we know it simply would not exist without them.   \n\nJoin acclaimed British biologist, Dr. Merlin Sheldrake, on a quest to find an incredibly precious blue mushroom, against the backdrop of Tasmania's ancient Tarkine rainforest. Merlin will show us some the grandest and strangest organisms ever discovered, showcased through jaw-dropping time-lapse cinematography, in a landscape largely unchanged from the time of the dinosaurs. \n\nFungi have important lessons to teach humanity about survival through cooperation. Indeed, these incredible lifeforms may hold the key to solving some of humanity's most urgent problems. With millions more species to discover, our journey into the secret world of fungi has only just begun.\n\nFor all who enjoyed our film in 2024 - this is more of Stephen Axford's work - it will be another awe inspiring film.

Drawn from the vaults of Renaissance raunch, Medieval monasterian excess and daring modern transgressions, Garden of Earthly Delights offers a vocal cornucopia of surprise and surreptitiously cheeky delight, probing the pleasures and perils of excess.\n\nProgram to include music by Josquin, Banchieri, Gallus and new works by Nicole Murphy and Archie Tulk.",

Hidden between the world of plants and animals, another world exists: ''Fungi: Web of Life. We'll begin in the mysterious world of the forest floor, where fungi are the central players in nature's story of birth, death, and rebirth to discover that life as we know it simply would not exist without them.   \n\nJoin acclaimed British biologist, Dr. Merlin Sheldrake, on a quest to find an incredibly precious blue mushroom, against the backdrop of Tasmania's ancient Tarkine rainforest. Merlin will show us some the grandest and strangest organisms ever discovered, showcased through jaw-dropping time-lapse cinematography, in a landscape largely unchanged from the time of the dinosaurs. \n\nFungi have important lessons to teach humanity about survival through cooperation. Indeed, these incredible lifeforms may hold the key to solving some of humanity's most urgent problems. With millions more species to discover, our journey into the secret world of fungi has only just begun.\n\nFor all who enjoyed our film in 2024 - this is more of Stephen Axford's work - it will be another awe inspiring film. Have a look at the trailer and Stephen's photos.",

The audience will be encouraged to participate in the screening of the film. There will be warnings so those who are squeamish can avoid the really scary bits.   \n\nAn injured forest ranger on a routine mission is saved by two off-the-grid survivalists. What is initially a welcome rescue grows more suspicious as the son and his father reveal a cultish devotion to the forest where a fungi of monumental proportions proliferates at night, gathering strength, threatening to take over the earth. \n\nGaia has a lot to say about humanity's destruction of the environment and the tipping point we have collectively reached in the Anthropocene, but the film says it with creativity, flights of imagination and even humour. It's a thought-provoking and disturbing film.",

They explore the effect that different clay, glaze and inks create in the works.\n\nTika Robinson grew up on a cattle and truffle farm in rural NSW. She attended UNSW Art and Design, completing a Fine Arts degree with Honours. She is currently exploring ceramic fungus sculptural works with an ink element. \n\nTika explores the contrast that can be created and discovered with diametrically opposing ideas. Through her work she studies ideas such as life and death, and decay and growth, exploring the decay to regenerative process that fungi produce.  TIka looks at the contrast of humans and nature delving into the depths of the natural ecosystems. She studies the ecosystems of mycelia networks that connect multiple organisms and fungi underground. These networks highlight the connection and distribution of the world's regeneration. \n\nThe event is open during library hours in Bermagui.",

Hidden between the world of plants and animals, another world exists: ''Fungi: Web of Life. We'll begin in the mysterious world of the forest floor, where fungi are the central players in nature's story of birth, death, and rebirth to discover that life as we know it simply would not exist without them.   \n\nJoin acclaimed British biologist, Dr. Merlin Sheldrake, on a quest to find an incredibly precious blue mushroom, against the backdrop of Tasmania's ancient Tarkine rainforest. Merlin will show us some the grandest and strangest organisms ever discovered, showcased through jaw-dropping time-lapse cinematography, in a landscape largely unchanged from the time of the dinosaurs. \n\nFungi have important lessons to teach humanity about survival through cooperation. Indeed, these incredible lifeforms may hold the key to solving some of humanity's most urgent problems. With millions more species to discover, our journey into the secret world of fungi has only just begun.\n\nFor all who enjoyed our film in 2024 - this is more of Stephen Axford's work - it will be another awe inspiring film. Have a look at the trailer and Stephen's photos.",

This set the wheels in motion for what has become a very rich and enduring touring history with over twelve years on the world stage, performing to well over half a million enthusiastic patrons in over thirty countries, who have aptly described Andrews' performance as fantastic, brilliant, the real deal and a real showman. Greg Andrew and his band pay homage to Elton John in his two-hour concert production, which takes its name from one of the British singer-songwriter's most-loved tracks – Rocketman.\n\nRocketman in Concert - On Reflection Tour celebrates the Greatest Hits from the Elton John and Bernie Taupin collection!

Through an investigation of DNA exhaling in our breath and inhale from others, the work highlights the intimacy of unnoticed exchanges with human and non-human others, and ‘contamination’ as a necessary condition of being.\n\nA performance video depicts artist Helen Pynor and bioinformatician Jimmy Breen collecting a shared breath sample. DNA extracted from this breath was found to comprise 93% human DNA, with the remaining 7% belonging to around 6,700 microbial species. Based on a sound score by composer Amanda Cole, classically trained singers sing and whisper the Latin names of hundreds of these species, brought into the gallery as an 8-channel sound work.",

        "description": "Waggaroos is an orienteering club with regular local events in bush and urban environments.  \n\nDuring the summer months the Club focuses on urban/street events in Wagga Wagga. Events are generally in the format of either a score event using the MapRun app on your mobile phone or a score event where runners nominate a course time of either 30 minutes or 45 minutes during which time the competitor attempts to find as many controls as possible in any order using a hard copy map.\n\nDuring the cooler months, its focus is on bush events on maps located in and around Wagga and some that are 45 minutes drive from Wagga.\n\nOrienteering is a sport that combines outdoor adventure with map reading and navigational skills. It involves navigating through the bush, parks, or streets with the aid of a specially produced map and an orienteering compass, with the aim being to locate checkpoints (controls) on various natural and man-made features along the way, such as a boulder, track junction, bench seat or streetlamp.\n\nNew members are welcomed at all events with courses for all levels of experience will be available for all members of the family to enjoy.\n\nVisit the Waggaroos website for details on the full year’s event calendar, start locations and event times.",

Here she made a vegetable garden, lived with the beauty, simplicity and peace of country life, as well as with drought and bushfire. Out of this period of her life came these exquisitely beautiful photographs capturing family, nature and life in a small rural farming community. Every image evoking intense emotion ranging from joy to melancholy. In 2015 Five Mile Press published a book of the Mother Country images and since then the images have been widely exhibited to critical acclaim.\n\nHelga Salwe’s work is exhibited both within Australia and internationally. The Mother Country exhibition has been featured at the 'Pingyao International Photography Festival' in China, the 'Headon Photo Festival' in Sydney and the 'Auckland Photo Festival' in New Zealand. Her work is held in both private and public collections, including The National Portrait Gallery of Australia, The National Library of Australia and The Epworth Art Foundation. She has been shortlisted twice for the prestigious Bowness Photographic Prize and holds a Masters in Contemporary Art from the Victorian College of the Arts. She is also a member of Mapgroup, an independent collective of documentary photographers.",

Her journey with clay, which began in childhood, has been shaped by global experiences in community studios, an internship in Bali, and residencies in Japan and Italy. These influences breathe life into her pieces, reflecting the delicate interplay of light and shadow in nature.\n\nHer latest collection features hand-formed vessels and intricate botanical arrangements, adorned with seeds, petals, and vine-like details that evoke untamed natural beauty. The muted tones of unglazed black and white clay emphasize raw authenticity.\n\nThis exhibition contemplates the cyclical nature of life, exploring the strength found in fragility and the balance between humanity and nature. Hotson invites viewers to uncover the resilience hidden in shadows, celebrating nature's capacity for renewal amidst adversity.",

In May 2019, Killer Queen performed in Russia for the first time. They have also shared the bill with the likes of Jeff Beck, Foreigner, Journey, Twisted Sister, Thin Lizzy and Kelly Rowland. \n\nJohn Blunt’s (lead singer) resemblance to Freddie Mercury is uncanny, appearing live to 7 million viewers on the French TV show “Qui Sera Le Meilleur Sosie? -  Who will be the best impersonator” and John was chosen by UK’s ITV Channel 5 for the docu/drama “The Freddie Mercury Story – Who Wants to Live Forever”, a detailed look into the personal life and death of Freddie Mercury, screening in the UK, Europe and North America in 2016.\n\nThis two-hour live show consists of all Queen's Greatest Hits (and stage costumes), including Bohemian Rhapsody, We Will Rock You, We Are the Champions, Somebody to Love, Radio Ga Ga, Another One Bites the Dust and many more.\n\nThis will be an unforgettable Killer Queen Experience!",

Invariably, there are passages where one instrument leads; this holds for most conversations. Like good conversation, sensitive listening shapes the quality of the musical response. \n\nA recently formed duo, Rio and Cedar, share a musical heritage that gives them great joy in performing sonata repertoire together. Rio has been a long-term student of Natalia Ricci, and Cedar studied piano with Gian-Franco Ricci for eight years. These relationships have nurtured the beauty of communicating stories and emotional landscapes through music. \n\nRio has won numerous international accolades for his piano performances, including appearances as a soloist with multiple orchestras in Asia, the United States, and Australia. He recently placed second in the 2024 Australian National Piano Awards and is an accomplished composer. Cedar studies at the Manhattan School of Music with Prof. Lucie Robert and is grateful to be supported by the President's Scholarship. Cedar has performed as a soloist in Australia, North America, and Europe. She was recently awarded the Troussov Award at the Engers Academy in Frankfurt, Germany.",

Each piece serves as a reflection of the fluidity of memory, revealing how experiences can be reshaped, embellished, or entirely reimagined over time. \n\nThis work challenges the notion of memory as a static archive, presenting it instead as a dynamic, living narrative—a blend of fact and fiction. By embroidering between the gaps and distortions in recollected memory, she creates sense of misremembered nostalgia.",

        "description": "Sevenmarks Gallery is pleased to present a highly anticipated new body of work by the acclaimed artist Scott Chaseling. Titled Liquid Geometry, Chaseling has built a reputation for pushing the boundaries of contemporary glass art, and these new pieces continue to innovate and narrate material experiences.\n\nHighly technical, and calling on three decades of experience, Chaseling’s “pots” as he likes to call them, have a playful sculptural quality – indeed they almost appear “liquid”. The exhibition is completed with a series of glass and steel sculptures, and mixed media wall works that explore the interplay of light, colour and form. \n\nChaseling's work is renowned for its meticulous craftsmanship and conceptual depth, inviting viewers to engage with the materiality and ephemeral nature of glass. This is his first major solo exhibition at Sevenmarks gallery.",
